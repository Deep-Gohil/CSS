        Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] <br> as
        a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the <br>
        liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the
        Nativity <br> Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
        culminates on <br> Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated
        religiously by a <br> majority of Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10] and forms an
        integral part of the <br> holiday season surrounding it.
